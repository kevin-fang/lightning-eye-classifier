# Tiling Search
Before running, the tiled datasets must be downloaded.   
This includes: `assembly.00.hg19.fw.fwi` and `assembly.00.hg19.fw.gz`

If you have `arv` installed, this can simply be run by setting the API key and then running the following commands in this directory:

`arv-get b8835cbca4f8dfd3396f39f5ca10bb84+780/assembly.00.hg19.fw.fwi . && arv-get b8835cbca4f8dfd3396f39f5ca10bb84+780/assembly.00.hg19.fw.gz .`
