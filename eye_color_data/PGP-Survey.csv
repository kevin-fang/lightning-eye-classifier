This and cytochrome P450 imputations are perhaps the most important info that a participant can derive from whole genome results. Can we consider blanket application to all participants??

Some of my four children's eyes (all blue or blue with hazel rings or flecks) have lightened through the years (oldest is only 12, youngest not yet four).  My younger sister's blue eyes lightened a lot more than mine, and I've noticed the two of my children with hazel elements in their blue eyes have had their blue lighten up more than the other two.  My nearly-four-year-old daughter has dark blue eyes and looks almost identical to what I did at that age (not just eyes, but overall).  I doubt hers will lighten much; they haven't yet.

My paternal side of family are all blue-eyed, but again, there's a mix of tone.  I think everyone started out with dark or medium blue, and while some reached adulthood with medium to dark blue, others' eyes lightened, to end up with light-medium (no really light/pale blues in our family).  In general, but there may be exceptions, I've observed through the years that the dark-haired (med to dark brown) ones of us have kept a darker spectrum of blue in our eyes, while the lighter-haired (light brown to blonde) members tend to be the ones whose eyes have lightened more.

I have high-degree myopia (-9.50 and -10.00 glasses prescription; -8.00 and -8.50 in contacts).  Some members of my family also have myopia but not nearly as bad as mine.  My sister is the closest, and her contacts prescription is around -3.25.

Three of my four children have followed the same pattern: dark brown when born, a lighter color during toddler years (in their case, various shades of blonde), then darkening again.  Last child has maintained dark-medium brown hair since birth to current age of nearly four.","My maternal grandmother was a native of England, Irish descent.  White American maternal grandfather (don't know history).  Both my paternal grandparents were half Scottish, half German. I attribute my dad's side of the family's members all sporting piercing blue eyes to the German descent.","Right, except when batting a ball or firing a rifle, because my left eye is my master."

my dad has weird grey eyes. I don't know what his looked like when he was young, but my daughter was born with pale blue eyes like me and they darkened as she aged. she's 16 now and her eyes look exactly like my dad's eyes. it's a kind of grey that almost doesnt seem like a real color when you look right at it. kind of a dull steel-ish color that looks different depending on the surroundings. like seeing silverware at the bottom of a creek.

my dad has one eye that rolls sideways, and my daughter has permanent double vision and no depth perception because her eyes both roll away from each other.  the doctor said her brain would delete one eye but it never did. 

my daughter was diagnosed with ""retinal migraines"" in addition to her eye roll. she was also born pretty strongly farsighted. my dad wears a super strong prescription as well but I don't know his specifics.

my left eye doesn't close all the way and I have to cover it when I sleep, but I think that's from an injury. 

my daughter didn't open her eyes at all for the first six weeks or so after she was born and then she slept with her eyes completely open every night until she was about 15 months old.
